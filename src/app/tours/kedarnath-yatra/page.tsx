          <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4">
            The Kedarnath Yatra is a sacred pilgrimage to one of the twelve Jyotirlingas of Lord Shiva. Located in the Rudraprayag district of Uttarakhand at an altitude of 3,583 meters above sea level, the Kedarnath Temple stands against the backdrop of the magnificent Kedarnath peak.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4">
            This 7-day journey takes you through scenic Himalayan landscapes, along the banks of the holy Mandakini River, culminating in a spiritually enriching visit to the ancient temple. The trek to Kedarnath is a challenging but rewarding experience that combines physical endurance with spiritual enlightenment.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4">
            The best time to visit Kedarnath is from May to June and September to October when the weather is pleasant and the temple is open to devotees. The temple remains closed during winter months due to heavy snowfall.
